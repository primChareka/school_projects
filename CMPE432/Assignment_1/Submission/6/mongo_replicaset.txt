To create the MongoDB replica set, Azure VMs were used. Once MongoDB was installed, the following commands were run in different shells

`mongod –replSet “replicaset” --bind_ip 40.114.79.23, 40.114.70.147`

`mongo`
`rs.initiate(_id: “replicaset”, members: [{ _id: 0, host: “40.114.79.23:27017”}, { _id: 1, host: “40.114.70.147”}]})`
